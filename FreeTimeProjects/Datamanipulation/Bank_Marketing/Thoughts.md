**Bank Marketing**

Learned how effective it is to categorize numerical data, even the most simple ones. Yes the accuracy may decrease accurasy, 
but it is such a performance booster whit predictions. And if you want more accarcy from the model you can always add more categories. 

Filtering unnecessary data and not be afraid of removing data in fear of decrease in accuracy, 
in lot of cases it actaully makes the model better. 

Presenting data... To be fair I did OK job. This excel could be better, but I'm still bit clueless how one should present data, 
simply and yet so that it would be easy to understand.<br> 
I'm proud of the interactive chart. And would like to add single prediction that uses python scrpt.

Where I  would like to improve on and final thought's <br>
Presenting. Excel is hot mess at the moment. Maybe I should have looked up some examples before doing this project. 
But over all I'm happy and this makes me really hopeful of the career choice. <br><br>  On to the next one... What ever that might be
